description: Want to gradually introduce ts-rest to your project?
---

The ideal way to use `ts-rest` is to control both the client and server, however, we don't live in a perfect world where we can afford to rewrite everything at once! This guide will show you how to use `ts-rest` without a backend, commonly utilised to help migrate an existing application to `ts-rest`.

## Adding `@ts-rest` to your project

<InstallTabs packageName="@ts-rest/core @ts-rest/react-query" />

This command installs the core, and the `react-query` adapter. We strongly recommend using `react-query` as it is a fantastic way to handle many common problems with data fetching in react, and ts-rest provides first class support for it.

## Initialise a Contract

The first step is to create a contract, normally in the ts-rest docs we advise you to create this in a shared library, either in a monorepo or published to a package registry. However, for this guide we're going to create it in the same project as the client.

```typescript
const c = initContract();

export const contract = c.router({
  getPosts: {
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/posts',
    responses: {
      200: c.type<{ posts: Post[]; total: number }>(),
    },
    query: z.object({
      take: z.string().transform(Number).optional(),
      skip: z.string().transform(Number).optional(),
      search: z.string().optional(),
    }),
    summary: 'Get all posts',
  },
  // ...
});
```

Read our [core guide](/docs/core) to learn more about contracts.

## Setup react-query in your project

It's worth following the excellent `@tanstack/react-query` [installation guide](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/quick-start) to get started with `react-query`. We're going to assume you've already done this (snippet below)

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// Create a client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const App = () => {
  return (
    // Provide the client to your App
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <Todos />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
};
```

## Consume the Contract

Now that we have a contract, we can use it to create a client. We're going to use `react-query` to handle the data fetching, but you can use any data fetching library you want.

```tsx
import { contract } from './contract';

export const client = initQueryClient(contract, {
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3333',
  baseHeaders: {},
});

const YourComponent = () => {
  const queryResult = client.getPosts.useQuery(
    ['posts'], // <- queryKey
    { query: { take: 10 } }, // <- Query params, Params, Body etc (all typed)
    { staleTime: 1000 }, // <- react-query options (optional)
  );

  // ... use the query result
};
```

:::info

You should probably put the client somewhere accessible to all components, possibly at the top level of your application.

## Next Steps

Now that you're using ts-rest in a non-breaking way you're in an excellent position to experiment with your team, if the experiment is successful you can start to migrate your backend to use ts-rest, all incrementally and without breaking your application!
